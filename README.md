# shim

shim is a github public repository for the [Multicore Association SHIM specification](http://www.multicore-association.org/workgroup/shim.php) compliant reference open source software. The most central tool is SHIM Editor, a reference implementation of SHIM XML authoring tool. It also hosts sample SHIM XML and CCF XML files, along with the sample application implementation that shows how to use CCF XML files. Another tool is called SHIM Performance Measurement Plugin, which is an Eclipse plugin that can be used to measure the performance of hardware described in SHIM XML. Altogether, SHIM Editor is used for creating a SHIM XML except for the performance values in the XML, which is measured by the SHIM Performance Measurement Plugin that uses the SHIM XML to generate the performance measurement code, and merging the measurement result back to the XML. For SHIM2.0 and IEEE 2804, see [shim2](https://github.com/openshim/shim2).
